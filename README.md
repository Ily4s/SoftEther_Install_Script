SoftEther Install Script
========================

- You might want to update the download links in the first few lines
- Default password is "password", please change.
- Don't enable DNS traversing as it will conflict with the DHCP server.
- If the speeds are low, try lowering encryption settings

This script has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, other distros using apt for repo/package management "should" work fine.

Client and Server Manager can be downloaded from http://www.softether-download.com/en.aspx
